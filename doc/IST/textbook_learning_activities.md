### Task 2 Automated systems

* Read chapter 14.6 Automated control page 300.

* Task 2 Atomated systems

Write a program to control a LEGO model. The program is to control a set of traffic lights to manage vehicles at an intersection. In a later task, you will develop the model.
1 On paper, design a set of vehicle traffic lights. Draw the lights and list the components, such as green light, amber light and red light.
2 Write down the rules required to operate the model. For example, the light will be green for 10 seconds. Next the amber light should go-on far 2 seconds, and the red light will turn on for 10 seconds.
3 Build the traffic light with your LEGO kit. Connect the traffic light to the computer or interface if necessary. Write the program by converting your set of written instructions to appropriate computer instructions.
4 Run the program and document the results. Now modify the program to control a T-intersection. Remember, when the lights are green one way, they must be displaying red for the other direction. The lights must not change to red without first showing amber.
