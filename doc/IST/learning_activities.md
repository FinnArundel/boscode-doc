2 Write down the rules required to operate the model. For example, the light will be green for 10 seconds. Next the amber light should go-on far 2 seconds, and the red light will turn on for 10 seconds.  
3 Build the traffic light with your LEGO kit. Connect the traffic light to the computer or interface if necessary. Write the program by converting your set of written instructions to appropriate computer instructions.
