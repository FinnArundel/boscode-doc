## Installation

### Windows

Follow instructions : https://slik.stlukes.nsw.edu.au/downloading-office-365/


### Mac

Students can access an RDS instance here at school to run 
MSAccess. First, make sure you have the 
Microsoft RDP Application on your macs - 
this can be downloaded from Self Service, or direct from the 
Apple App Store for free at https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/microsoft-remote-desktop /id715768417?mt=12

Once you've done that, you need to download the configured shortcut
(.rdp file). This only needs to be done once. To do this:
In a web browser, go to https://remote.stlukes.nsw.edu.au
Log in with the school username and password. NOTE: You must include "stlukes\" BEFORE your username, e.g. "stlukes\student2018"
After logging in, click the "Virtual Desktop" link. This will download the RDP shortcut you need


Once that has all been done, all you need to do then is double-click the RDP file that was downloaded, and log in with your school username and password.

Microsoft Access is available on the desktop, and you will 
have access to your old school "Home Drive" to save and work 
on your database files.
