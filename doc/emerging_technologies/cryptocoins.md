* Date it was created   
* Assessment of the effects of alt coin on the individual, society and the environment in the context of software development  


The creation and development of Bitcoin back in 2009 represents an incredible innovation that has pro-
vided the very foundation of the blockchain we see today. Bitcoin, however, while excellent in its creation
and proven in its robustness, has many limitations regarding scalability, flexibility and performance. Even
though it has stood the test of time, it does not necessarily mean it is perfect.
Through its day-to-day usage over the last eight years or so, the technology has been tested. Its weak-
nesses have been seen and its deficiencies noted. That said, as a core protocol, despite a few hiccoughs
along the way, it has remained relatively untouched. In many ways, Bitcoin can be regarded as the "elder
statesman" of the cryptocurrency world. It represents the core foundation upon which almost every other
blockchain, private or public, will be designed, built and, ultimately, judged. The challenge is that it cannot
hope to be "one-size-fits-all" to satisfy an ever-changing marketplace.
Bitcoin represented a paradigm shift, and as such represents a completely new technology layer. It
creates new ways to do things. It stimulates ideas that evolve and grow as the technology grows. In many
ways, this evolution becomes self-fulfilling as the technology-opportunity cycle takes over.
The more the technology is used, the more it evolves. The more it evolves, the greater the volume of
opportunities it creates and the more it is used, with this cycle continuing onwards and upwards.
Bitcoin has established itself as the known, stable platform. It is the market that drives change in this
fast-moving space. Whether it be to look at increasing the number of transactions per second or the ability
to perform smart contracts, others have reacted to the market who might have had the very simple notion
of "Wouldn't it be great if Bitcoin could do .... this?" (whatever this might be).
Whenever there is a vacuum, it usually gets filled. This is where entrepreneurs and developers have a
meeting of minds to build new ideas that the market wants that cannot be serviced from the existing
solutions. This is where alternative coins (called altcoins) derive their power. This power, however, doesn't
happen overnight.
Alternative coins take time to develop, with most satisfying a particular need or requirement. While
many might develop new ideas for the technology, the final release may not materialise for 12, 18 months,
even two years down the track.
In this section, we will look at some of the top alternative coins that have been developed and ones that
are also currently in development, where each coin has particular nuances or niche use cases that can add
significant value to particular market requirements, whatever those might be.
The following is a list ten altcoins to watch. It is designed to give you a flavour of where the upcoming
blockchain-based technologies are heading. By understanding the basic offerings of the upcoming tech-
nologies and how they are being used, you will have a proactive guide as to where future opportunities
could lie.
These future opportunities might need some out-of-the-box thinking, However, by using these develop-
ments as a foundation for thought, who knows where or how you might find a use for them. The opportu-
nities are only limited by your imagination. Now before you put your exuberance into overdrive, I do need
to give a brief word of caution.
While many of the technologies described below have great potential, they are constantly changing and
evolving. It is important to understand this review represents a snapshot at a given point in time, and
that given the lightning-fast pace of the blockchain, the technologies described may indeed change from
their original format and structure and new technologies may supersede them. It is more important to
recognise that staying in touch with the altcoin markets gives you a great proactive indication of where
the technology will head.
Overall, there are around 620 alternative coins in the market currently, and an entire book could be
devoted to writing about the nuances of all of them. So, in assessing the altcoins we consider worth watch-
ing, our core criteria have been based around:
-	the features the altcoins have to offer and
-	how the market is viewing their value - usually, through their market capitalisation: the price of the
coin, expressed in Bitcoin, multiplied by the number of coins in existence.


Disclaimer: The enclosed reviews below are for guidance and education purposes only and should not be
considered as investment advice. Trading in cryptocurrencies carries with it very high risks as the cryp-
tocurrency markets have little or no regulation in place. Professional guidance should always be sought
before considering making any investment in the cryptocurrency space.

##1. Ethereum
https://www.ethereum.org/ 

Ethereum initially established itself as the "smart-contract blockchain". It is the most recognised platform
that enables smart contracts to be effected. Its wider vision is to establish itself as the world's first "de-
centralised computer", or virtual machine on a public blockchain. To do this, it has a powerful scripting
language that is described as Turing Complete, meaning, in principle, it can be used to solve any computa-
tional problem completely.
Many new applications are being built on top of the Ethereum platform, not only smart contract-based
applications but also applications that are decentralised - in other words, the applications are spread over
the whole network. These are called decentralised apps, or "DApps" for short.
Examples of DApps being developed using the Ethereum platform include everything from decen-
tralised fund management platforms to a decentralised digital rights management platform.
Many start-ups are also building their products on Ethereum, linking them to Internet of Things (IoT)
devices. Ethereum has attracted substantial developer buy-in since its launch in 2014, with hundreds
of developers working on projects on Ethereum around the world. Microsoft has also partnered with
Ethereum, which will undoubtedly help with its wider commercial and corporate adoption.
Ethereum is very ambitious in its goals. At its latest DEVCON2 conference in Shanghai in late September
2016, Ethereum announced its ambitions to essentially re-write the internet in a decentralised structure
with the advent of web 3.0, where peer- to-peer technologies will drive the underlying infrastructure. This,
in theory at least, could lead to an internet that cannot be censored.
Ethereum is the primary alternative coin to watch out for, as in only a couple of years, Ethereum has
clearly established itself as the number two cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, following its $ 18m capital raise
from its ICO in 2014. It also has a big following amongst the developer community that is helping to drive
adoption.

2. Ripple

Website: https://ripple.com/

Ripple is a controversial cryptocurrency because it was (and still is) majority owned by the Ripple Foun-
dation which holds the power to change the underlying protocol. Ripple is perhaps the most "corporate"
of altcoins and has geared its activities more towards the enterprise market, such as financial institutions,
rather than the end consumer.
Ripple is a blockchain-based gross-settlement system, which can settle all types of asset-backed
blockchain tokens in real time, from gold to currencies. Ripple was open-sourced after it was released and
continues to be so. The Ripple Foundation, however, is looking to pivot away from using a blockchain to
instead connecting the various financial transfer systems around the world. In many quarters, Ripple is
being dubbed as "Swift 2.0" - almost seeking to supersede Swift, which is the underlying payments tech-
nology that connects international banks. I feel sure that Swift will fight back against this definition.
As an indication of their ongoing success, in July 2016, Ripple announced a collaboration between Cana-
dian financial institution ATB Financial, German software multinational SAP, Ripple Labs and the German
bank ReiseBank AG. They demonstrated the potential of their technology when an international payment
took 20 seconds from Canada to Germany as compared to several working days. This 20-second benchmark
will undoubtedly become a key target for other financial institutions.

3. Monero

Website: https://getmonero.org/

Monero is a cryptocurrency that is focused on privacy. In Bitcoin, every transaction can be traced back to an
original transaction and to the original block containing that transaction. To the creators of Monero, this
is not good for privacy as the source of a transaction can be easily found, albeit the transaction is expressed
in the form of a public key containing multiple letters and digits. However, such an analysis is not possible
in Monero.
It uses its dedicated CryptoNight algorithm to achieve this goal that, at a very simple level, make it im-
possible to tell which original public keys made the transaction. Privacy is maintained as a result.
Now while privacy can be very important, regarding hiding purchases from snooping corporates whose
business is based around using our transactional behaviour, it is the negative side of privacy, secrecy, that
tends to rear its head. Because of the focus on complete privacy, Monero is increasingly being used in the
Dark Net markets that are so often used for illegal purposes that require cryptocurrency that cannot be
easily traced.
Undoubtedly, this currency is being monitored closely by regulators, the law enforcement agencies and
anti-terrorism bodies. The challenge for the regulators will be how they will ultimately control this tech-
nology, given the technology is decentralised and spread across multiple public networks. I suspect, over
time, the regulators will ultimately seek to ban the actual use of this type of currency or indeed try to make
it illegal to mine this style of cryptocurrency coin, with a cat-and-mouse game undoubtedly ensuing.

4. Steem

Website: https://steem.io/

Steem is a cryptocurrency that powers Steemit.com, a blogging and social networking website. On the
Steemit website, anyone can contribute articles and comment on others' articles, follow his or her
favourite writers, and bookmark stories they like. However, Steemit is different from other blogging and
social networking sites. The site rewards its users for the production of the best quality content.
Steemit offers two types of rewards - author rewards and curation rewards, all in the form of Steem,
their cryptocurrency. When someone "upvotes" a story, the author is given a STEEM reward. However, if
many other people then subsequently "upvote" an article, the original upvoters are also rewarded with
STEEM, based on what are called "curation rewards". This ensures that people have an incentive to try and
upvote good quality content that will be liked by the others in the community as well. Together, the web-
site is designed to create and reward a central source of high-quality content.
Steem is finding many use cases for bloggers and content producers who can earn money for their work.
Many people are posting original content on Steemit instead of Medium or their own blogs because they
can easily share this content with others while also making money in the process. Because this is a rela-
tively recent development, the number of users on the site is comparatively low, but once people see there
is an opportunity to generate income from high quality content, expect to see a marked rise in the activity
on the Steem platform.

5. Waves

Website: https://wavesplatform.com/

Waves is a blockchain that allows other blockchain projects to issue their tokens in an easy-to-use-and-
understand manner. As part of its tokenisation methodology, it enables real-world collateralised curren-
cies like USD or EUR and even commodities like silver and gold to be tokenised. Waves had a very successful
ICO in mid-2016, raising around 30,000 BTC (around $ 16.5m at the time).
A use case that summarises how this platform could be used is an organisation called Incent that is
looking at cryptocurrency incentive structures for retailers interested in offering loyalty bonuses based
around convertible cryptocurrencies. Instead of retailers offering, for example, air miles or reward points
to customers and having to hold these on their balance sheet as an ongoing liability, Incent offers cryp-
tocurrency loyalty incentives, called Incents. These Incents are cryptocurrencies that can be converted
into local fiat currency immediately (via the Waves platform) or held to buy future products within the
Incent network. It's an interesting use case, and with time, could work. While I think the challenge may be
the acceptance by end customers of a cryptocurrency when very few end consumers understand how cryp-
tocurrencies work, it is the Waves platform that has enabled the automatic conversion to fiat currency. As
an enabling platform, Waves is one to watch.

6. Storj

Website: https://storj.io/

Storj is a very interesting technology that a number of cryptocurrencies are trying to emulate. Storj is de-
centralised cloud storage, where files can be stored across a decentralised network. The idea is that the files
that you own are sharded, in other words, shredded into very small pieces. Those shards are then stored on
individuals' excess hard drive storage on their computers around the world, but only the owner of the file's
private key has access to the complete file. Those that offer their excess storage on their hard drives are paid
in Storj cryptocurrency coins, which are convertible to fiat currency. The technology is in very early devel-
opment but represents a very interesting use case for decentralised, secure cloud storage.

7. DigixDAO

Website: https://www.dgx.io/

Digix is an Ethereum-based token that is backed by physical gold in vaults. It is essentially a gold token that
exists on the Ethereum blockchain and can be purchased with Bitcoin or Ethereum. It runs a full-reserve
gold system, i.e., every token that is issued is backed by an equivalent amount of gold stored in vaults in
Singapore. This is similar to the way traditional currencies were historically tied to the gold standard and
backed by gold, DigixDAO provides a similar structure. It may get traction from corporates wanting a half-
way house between something that is backed by assets with a clear, tangible value and a cryptocurrency
coin that has to rely on its own network effect - like Steem or Bitcoin.

8. Augur

Website: https://www.augur.net/

Augur is a decentralised prediction marketplace built on the Ethereum network. It allows individuals to
forecast events. It is based on the idea that the wisdom of the crowd is greater than the wisdom of one
individual. It rewards those that have voted with the majority and punishes those that vote against the
majority. Augur is thus the first decentralised Oracle system on the blockchain. It allows real-world intelli-
gence to be passed on to the blockchain through a peer-to-peer voting mechanism. Augur is yet to launch
their full production system, but the Alpha version has been launched and tested by the community. Use
cases being developed include prediction markets like sports betting and even the recent presidential elec-
tion odds.

9. Factom

Website: https://www.factom.com/

Factom is an established public blockchain solution to provide trusted data to users, enterprises, and gov-
ernments. It has validated over 64 million records to date. Factom has created its own blockchain that also
periodically anchors to other blockchains including Bitcoin, thus giving it a higher degree of immutability.
Factom has been looking at markets such as land registry in South America and other government and
enterprise applications that require data integrity, i.e., something cannot be changed after the fact. Factom
has recently secured grant funding from Homeland Security in the US to look at security of digital identity
on the blockchain for Internet of Things devices, and has been actively in discussions with the Chinese
government to look at administrative systems linked to the blockchain for smart cities, where IOT devices
provide marked levels of data relating to the management of a city. Factom is an established player and has
some interesting corporate ideas in development.

10. Lisk

Website: https://lisk.io/

Lisk is an Ethereum-like, Turing complete, smart-contract platform, which allows the blockchain to run
arbitrary smart contracts. Lisk is different from Ethereum in that it uses traditional JavaScript to en-
able decentralised applications. JavaScript is the web programming language of choice and deployed by
millions of developers across the globe. By working closely with recognised programming languages, it
means that blockchain applications could theoretically be produced significantly more quickly than those
requiring the deep, specialist knowledge of another blockchain such as Ethereum, which has its own lan-
guage. Lisk had a successful ICO in early 2016, and some applications are already beginning to be built, but
we can reasonably expect to see more developers use the platform as it is based in a language they easily
understand and can code quickly

Conclusion
The above list of altcoins shows the diversity in the future developments of the technology. These and
other new technologies will create and drive new products that haven't ever been seen before and will cre-
ate new opportunities. For those of you in corporates, altcoins present an opportunity for your organisa-
tion to be at the leading edge of innovation, although many of the technologies are in the very early stages
of development and may be 18 months to two years away from completion.
For those of you with an entrepreneurial bent, they present a potential greenfield of opportunity. How
you use these altcoins is up to you - but the opportunities are there. You just need to dig a little deeper
to understand how they could help you with your ideas, and your ideas are only constrained by your
imagination.
