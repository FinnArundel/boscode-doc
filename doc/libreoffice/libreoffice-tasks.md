## LibreOffice Base Classwork Task

Nature of Task: Database Design

### Context
This activity aims to assist students develop an understanding of database design and development and the method of collecting, organising, storing, processing and presenting information.  The students will also develop their skills in Project Management and learning disposition of Perseverance.  Perseverance becomes noticeable as designs are trialed and they do not work and then improved.  Students need to identify the key elements of database design, the function of a database and how to best display the data collected using suitable database software.

To prepare for this activity, students will learn about database design concepts, how to use a DBMS and how to manage and organise a project.

### Project Outline

Design and develop a database using LibreOffice Base to meet an identified need (example: Music, Cars, computer parts).  You will create a table, form, queries, reports, switchboard menu and use a macro.  A switchboard is used to navigate the database.

### Defining and analysing the problem
- Libre Office Base has been selected as a DBMS for this task.  Compare and contrast
  MySQL, MS Access and Libre Office Base and provide reasons to justify using Libre
  Office Base to design and create a database. (200 words)
- The the number of databases and the amount of data they hold has increased over the years.  Analyse the effect this information technology has on individuals and society. (200 words)
- Research one job offer from an online job search website (e.g. www.seek.com.au) for a career related to databases. Describe the roles and responsibilities that are required. (50 words)
- Outline the purpose of your database and describe your target market. (50 words).

### Design Possible Solutions
- Design a mind map to show the organisation of ideas for the database.
- Design a data dictionary for your table.  This should include the field name, data type, size, any validation, and an example. Identify the key field.
- Produce a detailed colour Storyboard sketch of the main switchboard a form and a report.  Each sketch should be A4 and labelled.  Provide an evaluation for your storyboard. (50 words)
- Draw an IPO Table to illustrate how a query interacts with the database.

### Producing Solutions
- Create the database and submit a screen shot of a table, form and report in design view and print out one page of the report.
- Create a user manual.  Ensure that you explain clearly what your application can do and provide reasons to justify your answer. (100 words).

### Database
You are to create a new database of your own design using Libre Office Base.  This database must be easy for anyone to use.

### Data Dictionary
- Must contain fields that are appropriate for the purpose of your database.
- A key field must be identified
- All fields must have the most appropriate data type and lengths.
- Minimum field number - 8
- Minimum data types include – text, number, Boolean, date.
- Validation: At least two of the following types with a message: value list, range, and max number of characters, data type.

### Table
- Should match the design of your Data Dictionary
- Must contain a minimum of 100 records – 10 records should be accurate and 90 records can be generated using a test data generator (e.g. http://www.generatedata.com/)

### Form
- The form must be a GUI and be user friendly with navigation and a close button.
- There must be a graphic on the form and all text should be clear to read and follow good design principals.

### Queries
- 6 queries must be produced: 2 x simple queries, 2 x AND, 2 x OR.

### Report
- All reports must have the records in Alphabetic order – by any field
- One report must be grouped
- One report must show all the records in the database table
- One report must be based on a query

### Macros
- A macro must open the form and enlarge it
- A macro must open the report contain all the records of the database in a separate window

### Switchboard
- Must be user friendly with name of your database and a graphic
- Must be a GUI with buttons
- Main switchboard must be displayed on startup. 

### Evaluation 
- Develop validation rules and ask another student to help test the database then write a report to outline how effective they are. (50 words)
- Analyse how you managed your time for this project.  Describe how Perseverance played a part in the level of your success. (100 words)
- Select three different stages of the design process for this project and critically analyse the decisions that you made.  (100 words)
- Review your original storyboard after you have completed the database.  Critically analyses reasons for altering your database design and reasons for following your database design. (100 words)
- Peer assess another students database and evaluate the screen design and navigation. (50 words)
